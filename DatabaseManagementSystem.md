## Data Normalisation and Denormalisation

| S.No. | Normalisation | Denormalisation |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | Reduces Redundancy | Adds Intentional Redundancy |
| 2 | Faster Writes (Faster Insert, Update, and Delete Operation) | Slower Writes |
| 3 | Slower Reads | Faster Reads (Faster Select Operation) |
| 4 | Optimised Disk Usuage | Wastage of Disk Space |
| 5 | More Joins needed while retriving of the data | Less Joins |
| 6 | Small and Many Tables |  Bigger and Less Tables |
| 7 | Application: OLTP (Where resouces are less)| OLAP (Where resources are easily accessible like in Cloud Computing era) |
