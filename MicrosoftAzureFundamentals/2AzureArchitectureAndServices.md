## Microsoft Azure
Azure provides more than 100 services that enable you to do everything from running your existing applications on virtual machines to exploring new software paradigms, such as intelligent bots and mixed reality.

### Practice on Sandbox
- Activate Sandbox
- Give Permissions
- Powershell will appear after authentification.
- Powershell Specific Command: Get-date
- Azure Specific Commands: az version
- **If youâ€™re more familiar with BASH, you can use BASH command instead by shifting to the BASH CLI.**
- Command: bash
- Bash specific Command: 
  - date
  - az upgrade
- You can change back to PowerShell mode by entering pwsh on the BASH command line.
- **Use Azure CLI interactive mode**
- Command: az interactive

- Once initialized, you can use the arrow keys or tab to help complete your commands. Interactive mode is set up specifically for Azure, so you don't need to enter az to start a command (but you can if you want to or are used to it). 
- Command: exit {to come out of Azure CLI interactive mode. }

### The core architectural components of Azure may be broken down into two main groupings: the physical infrastructure, and the management infrastructure.
