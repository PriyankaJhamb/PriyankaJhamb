## Microsoft Azure Fundamentals
Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform. 

Temporary Azure portal environment called the sandbox.

The main two services are provided by the cloud service provider:)
1. Compute Power
2. Storage
3. Application
4. Platform
5. Messaging

### Ideally without the use of cloud computing, all responsibilities need to be complete by the company which includes managing physical softwares, physical storage, power, cooling, security and network connectivity.
### Shared Responsibility Model between Customer and the cloud service provider.

### Types of Cloud Deployment Models
1. Public Cloud:
- open to all to store and access information via internet,
- pay as per use(for the services),
- managed by the third parties(cloud service provider)

#### Fundamental Characteristic of public cloud is Multitenancy.(Multi-tenancy is an architecture in which a single instance of a software application serves multiple customers.)
Examples: Google App Engine, Dropbox etc.
