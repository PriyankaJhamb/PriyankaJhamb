## Microsoft Azure Fundamentals
Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform. 

Temporary Azure portal environment called the sandbox.

The main two services are provided by the cloud service provider:)
1. Compute Power
2. Storage
3. Application
4. Platform
5. Messaging

### Ideally without the use of cloud computing, all responsibilities need to be complete by the company which includes managing physical softwares, physical storage, power, cooling, security and network connectivity.
### Shared Responsibility Model between Customer and the cloud service provider.

### Types of Cloud Deployment Models
#### 1. Public Cloud:
- open to all to store and access information via internet,
- pay as per use(for the services),
- managed by the third parties(cloud service provider)

##### Fundamental Characteristic of public cloud is Multitenancy.(Multi-tenancy is an architecture in which a single instance of a software application serves multiple customers.)
Examples: Google App Engine, Dropbox etc.

##### Advantages:
1. Cost effective (pay as per scale)
2. High scalability 
3. Feasibility: Location independent because its services are delivered through the internet.
4. Time efficient: Maintained by cloud service provider.

##### Disadvantages
1. Less secure because resources are shared publically.
2. Less customizable as compared to private cloud.
3. Less Data Privacy.
4. Less reliability.
#### 2. Private Cloud (Internal/ Corporate Cloud)
- services accessible within a  organisation i.e it belongs to a specific organisation.
- can be managed by organisation, 3rd party also.

##### Advantages:
1. Less feasibility: It is accessible within an organisation, so the area of operations is limited.
3. High security
3. Data Privacy
4. More customizable.
5. Improved reliability.

##### Disadvantages:
1. High Cost
2. Limited Scalability
3. Time used more.

#### 3. Hybrid Cloud
- features of public and private cloud
- critical activities performed by private cloud and non critical activites by public cloud.

##### Advantages:
1. Low cost as compare to private coud/
2. Scalability
3. Flexibility
4. Security

##### Disadvantages:
1. Managing is difficult/complex because there are more than 1 type of deployment model.
2. Maintainence: dependency on infrastructure 

#### 4. Community Cloud
- allows services to be accessible by a group of several organisations to share the information between the organisation & a specific community.
- owned, managed & operated by 1 or more organisations in the community or 3rd party.

##### Advantages:
1. Cost reduction/ Cost effective: It is cheaper than private cloud. Mutlitple companies share the bill, which lowers the cost.
2. sharing among the companies (like resources).
3. More secure than public cloud but less than private cloud.
##### Disadvantages:
1. consistent maintainence cost
2. Increased cost as compare to public loud.
